## Postulates of Quantum Mechanics
- ...
- Canonical Commutation Relation (CCR) *and Canonical Anti-Commutation Relation...*

## Non-relativistic Mechanics
### Statistical Interpretation
#### Operators and Observables
Physical observable quantities 
#### Space Representation
#### Momentum Representation

### Schrodinger Equation

$$i \hbar \dfrac{d}{dt} | \Psi \rangle = \hat{H} | \Psi \rangle $$

being $\hat{H}$ the Hamiltonian operator and $|\Psi\rangle$ the wave function, as a function of time $t$ as an independent variable.

#### Stationary States
Eigenspace of the Hamiltonian operator

$$\hat{H} |\Psi\rangle_i = E_i |\Psi\rangle_i \ ,$$

with $E_i$ energy.

### Matrix Mechanics

## Many-body problem
Wave function with symmetries: Fermions and Bosons

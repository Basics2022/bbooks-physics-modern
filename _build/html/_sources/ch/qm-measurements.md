# Measurements in Quantum Mechanics

**Contents.**
- Measurements: conversion from quantum systems to systems that can be explained by classical mechanics (instrument)
- Quantum decoherence: if quantum system is not perfectly isolated, coherence is shared from the system to the environment: mixing with many other degrees of freedom from the environment. The system doesn't evolve unitarily over time; thus the dynamics of the system alone are irreversible
